## The Golden Rule:

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

1. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
1. Validate each line of code before moving forward
1. Keep it Simple Simon (KISS)

## Making a plan

1. Make a drawing of your app. **Simple "wireframes"**
1. Once you have a drawing, **name the HTML elements** you'll need to realize your vision**
1. Determine the Components (sections) of your app.
1. Within each component:
    - For each HTML element ask: **Why do I need this?**
    - Does this element need **static content**, or is the content **dynamic state**?
    - If dynamic, what is **state** and what is it called
    - **Find all the 'events'** (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. 
1. For events, ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?
1. Once we know the _why_ of elements, state, and events -- think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
1. Think about how to **validate each of your features** according to a Definition of Done
1. Consider what features **_depend_ on what other features**. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.

## Guide to `app.js`

File parts:

1. import
2. state
3. components (one or more)
4. page load

Detailed description:

1. Imports 
    - bring in utility functions plus tested logic and render functions
1. State
    - data changes over time
    - constants with special meaning
1. View Components
    - Logical, meaningful, user-facing units of the UI 
    - Variables with DOM elements (A DOM element can only belong to one component)
    - Display functions that use state to render or update the view
    - Event subscriptions for DOM elements in this component
1. Handler Logic
    - Functions that perform actions based on events
    - directly in event handlers or grouped into `handleAction` functions
    - (call third party services)
    - Apply application logic
    - Update state
    - Call display functions to update view
1. Page Load
    - Logical pseudo-event of the initial page load
    - Like a "Handle Action" function, but code just goes at bottom of page

### Components

Logically grouped parts of the UI. A simple app may only have one component. Break each of these sections down into:

1. Define variables and assign via document methods (`getElementById`). A DOM element should only ever belong to one component
1. Display functions. These utilize the state and dom variables to perform dom updates. They may utilize user-facing formatting functions
1. Subscribe to needed events on DOM elements. These should update state or call state update functions

### Import

If needed, import functions and other JavaScript from their own modules. These will generally be pure functions:

1. App logic (game scoring)
1. Render functions (create html dynamically)
1. Utility functions (formatting, get a random number, etc.)

### State

The data that will change over time. Typically defined as `let` variables. These will be set and read from other code on the page.

#### Handler Functions

Code in event handlers, or repetitive code that is then grouped into handleAction functions. This code sites in-between events and state.

### Page Load

Code that should run when the page loads (other than event subscriptions which have already happened)

## TDD Pure Functions

- App and game logic functions that are pure and can be unit tested (TDD)
- Render functions (return dynamic Html based on input parameters)
